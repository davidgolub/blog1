This is a demonstration of Capta.
It can have files in formats like md, csv, vgl, sql, svg, png, and jpg.

## Capta-flavored Markdown

Let's start with a fake [dataset](people.csv) we generated at [Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/).
It's easy to show the CSV file in a table. Using this code:

````
```{csv file=./people.csv}
```
````

will get you this table:

```{csv file=./people.csv}
```
